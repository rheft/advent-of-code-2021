# Advent of Code 2021
2021 AoC solutions done in Rust. That's right. I've decided to drink to kool-aid, if you haven't heard from me in 3 days - I've successfully made the transition to a true Rustacean.  
These solutions will be ugly.  
These solutions will not be optimal.  
These solutions will probably only answer up to day 11.5.  

Good luck and god speed my AoC2021 friends. :)
